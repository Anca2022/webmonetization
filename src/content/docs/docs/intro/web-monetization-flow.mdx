Web Monetization uses the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide">Open Payments APIs</LinkOut> to coordinate transactions between Open Payments-enabled accounts. The Web Monetization (WM) agent issues API calls to both the receiving and sending accounts to obtain authorization and instructions for sending a payment.

This page provides an example set of API calls to illustrate the Web Monetization flow. The flow occurs between the key players defined below.

## Key players

- **Web Monetization provider** - An entity that provides a funded Open Payments-enabled account from which payments can be sent
- **Web Monetization agent** - Code within a web browser, such as an extension, that discovers web monetized pages, exposes the Web Monetization API, and communicates with the Open Payments APIs
- **Web monetized page** - A page that has implemented Web Monetization by including a well-formed monetization `<link>`
- **Web Monetization receiver** - An entity that provides an Open Payments-enabled account into which payments can be received

## Before you begin

- It's up to the site visitor, not the web monetized site, to decide how often and how much to pay, as well as the currency in which to send a payment.
- While Web Monetization helps coordinate payments, it doesn't move money. Payment processing and settlement must occur between the sending and receiving accounts, outside of Web Monetization, over a common payment rail. As such, the example below assumes the WM provider and WM receiver are peers and can transact with each other.

## Example flow

Alice web monetizes her site by adding the monetization `<link>` element to each page. The `<link>` element contains her payment pointer, `https://wallet.example/alice`.

Bob visits Alice's site and wants to send a Web Monetization payment. For this example, we assume:

- Bob has a relationship with a WM provider and the provider has supplied him with a sending account (`https://anotherwallet.example/bob`)
- Bob has installed a WM agent into his browser and linked the agent to his WM provider
- The WM agent has a grant to create outgoing payments on the sending account

<StylishHeader>Step 1 - Check for Web Monetization</StylishHeader>

As Bob browses Alice's site, his WM agent detects a well-formed monetization `<link>` element and fires a `load` event.

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
```

<StylishHeader>Step 2 - Issue request to payment pointer</StylishHeader>

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
  Open Payments API:{' '}
  <LinkOut href='https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/get-payment-pointer'>
    GET Payment Pointer
  </LinkOut>
</p>

The WM agent issues a request to Alice's payment pointer URL to discover the Open Payments service endpoint.

**Request**

```http
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: wallet.example
```

The response includes details about Alice's underlying Open Payments-enabled account. Importantly, it contains the URL for her WM receiver's grant request endpoint (authorization server).

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id":"https://wallet.example/alice",
    "assetCode":"USD",
    "assetScale":2,
    "authServer":"https://wallet.example/auth"
}
```

<StylishHeader>Step 3 - Send an incoming payment grant request</StylishHeader>

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
  Open Payments API:{' '}
  <LinkOut href='https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/post-request'>
    POST Grant Request
  </LinkOut>
</p>

The WM agent issues a request to the WM receiver's grant request endpoint (authorization server) to get an access token.

**Request**

In this example, the WM agent requests access to create and read incoming payments (i.e., payments coming in to Alice's WM receiver).

```http
POST /auth/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Host: wallet.example
Content-Length: 218

{
    "access_token": {
        "access":[
            {
                "type":"incoming-payment",
                "actions":["create","read"],
                "identifier":"https://wallet.example/alice"
            }
        ]
    },
    "interact":
        {
            "finish": {"method":"redirect"}
        },
    "client":"https://anotherwallet.example/bob"
}
```

**Response**

The grant request is non-interactive, so the WM receiver grants the request and issues an access token.

```http
{
    "access_token": {
        "value":"OS9M2PMHKUR64TB8N6BW7OZB8CDFONP219RP1LT0",
        "manage":"https://wallet.example/auth/token/dd17a202-9982-4ed9-ae31-564947fb6379"
            "access": [
                {
                    "type":"incoming-payment",
                    "actions":["create","read"],
                    "identifier":"https://wallet.example/alice"
                }
            ]
    },
}
```

<StylishHeader>Step 4 - Create an incoming payment request</StylishHeader>

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
  Open Payments API:{' '}
  <LinkOut href='https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-incoming-payment'>
    POST Incoming Payment
  </LinkOut>
</p>

The WM agent creates an incoming payment for the session (e.g., the open browser tab) by issuing an incoming payment request to the WM receiver. The request uses details obtained from the previous API calls.

:::note
_Incoming_ payment is used here because the WM agent is requesting that the WM receiver allow an incoming payment to Alice's account. The payment itself has not been sent yet.
:::

**Request**

```http
POST /alice/incoming-payments HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: OS9M2PMHKUR64TB8N6BW7OZB8CDFONP219RP1LT0
Host: wallet.example
```

**Response**

The WM receiver approves the request by supplying unique payment details for the WM agent to use to address the payment to Alice's account.

```http
{
    "id":"https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/08394f02-7b7b-45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c",
    "paymentPointer":"https://wallet.example/alice",
    "receivedAmount": {
        "value":"0",
        "assetCode":"USD",
        "assetScale":2
    },
    "completed":false,
    "createdAt":"2022-03-12T23:20:50.52Z",
    "updatedAt":"2022-03-12T23:20:50.52Z",
}
```

<StylishHeader>Step 5 - Send a quote request</StylishHeader>

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
  Open Payments API:{' '}
  <LinkOut href='https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-quote'>
    POST Quote
  </LinkOut>
</p>

Up to this point, the WM agent has communicated with Alice's WM receiver. Now, the WM agent issues a request to Bob's WM provider to create a quote. The purpose of the quote is to tell the WM provider how much to send from Bob's account.

**Request**

In this example, the WM agent creates a quote to send $0.02 USD from Bob to Alice.

Since we're assuming the WM agent already has a grant to create an outgoing payment on Bob's account, the grant access token will appear as the `Authorization` value in the header.

```http
POST /bob/quote HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: {{ quoteGrant.accessToken.value }}
Host: anotherwallet.example

{
    "receiver": "https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/08394f02-7b7b-45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c"
    "sendAmount": {
        "value":"2",
        "assetCode":"USD",
        "assetScale": 2
    }
}
```

**Response**

The WM provider returns a quote with information about how much it will cost for the provider to pay into the incoming payment.

```http
{
  "id": "https://anotherwallet.example/bob/quotes/8c68d3cc-0a0f-4216-98b4-4fa44a6c88cf",
  "paymentPointer": "https://anotherwallet.example/bob",
  "receiver": "https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/08394f02-7b7b-45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c"
  "sendAmount": {
    "value": "2",
    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "receiveAmount": {
    "value": "2",
    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "createdAt": "2022-03-12T23:20:50.52Z",
  "expiresAt": "2022-04-12T23:20:50.52Z"
}
```

<StylishHeader>Step 6 - Send outgoing payment request</StylishHeader>

<p style='font-size: 14px'>
  Open Payments API:{' '}
  <LinkOut href='https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/create-outgoing-payment'>
    POST Outgoing Payment
  </LinkOut>
</p>

The WM agent uses the details obtained thus far to create an outgoing payment request against Bob's payment pointer. Note that this is just a request to send a payment. The payment itself has not been sent yet.

**Request**

```http
POST /bob/outgoing-payment HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: {{ outgoingPaymentGrant.accessToken.value }}
Host: anotherwallet.example
Content-Length: 89

{
     "quoteId":
"https://anotherwallet.example/bob/quotes/8c68d3cc-0a0f-4216-98b4-4fa44a6c88cf"
}
```

**Response**

```http
{
     "id":"https://anotherwallet.example/bob/outgoing-payments/8c68d3cc-0a0f-
           4216-98b4-4fa44a6c88cf",
    "paymentPointer":"https://anotherwallet.example/bob/",
    "receiver":"https://wallet.example/alice/incoming-payments/08394f02-7b7b-
                45e2-b645-51d04e7c330c
    "receiveAmount": {
        "value":"2",
        "assetCode":"USD",
        "assetScale":2
    },
    "sendAmount": {
        "value":"2",
        "assetCode":"USD",
        "assetScale":2
    },
    "sentAmount": {
        "value":"0",
        "assetCode":"USD",
        "assetScale":2
    },
    "createdAt":"2022-03-12T23:20:55.52Z",
    "updatedAt":"2022-03-12T23:20:55.52Z"
}
```

The Web Monetization flow is complete. Now the WM provider can create a payment session with the WM receiver to process and settle the payment.
