Web Monetization aims to simplify the payment experience for website visitors and recipients. It's a proposed standard that:

- Allows websites to automatically signal to web browsers their acceptance of payments
- Enables web browsers to facilitate payments by:
  1. Obtaining authorization for a payment to be initiated
  2. Gathering details and issuing instructions to start the process of moving money
  3. Creating a [payment session](./resources/glossary#payment-session)
  4. Communicating events to the site so the site can optionally respond

It's important to understand that Web Monetization (WM) doesn't allow a website to specify a payment amount or currency. It only allows the site to tell the browser it can accept payments. With the help of a <Tooltip content='The entity sending a payment' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#web-monetization-provider">WM provider</a></Tooltip>, the site's visitor decides whether to make a payment, how much and how often to pay, and in which currency. The recipient's <Tooltip content='The entity receiving a payment' client:load><a href="./resources/glossary#web-monetization-receiver">WM receiver</a></Tooltip> can then exchange the currency of incoming payments based on what the recipient wants to receive. This flexibility allows both parties to choose the monetization method that best suits their needs.

It's also important to note that Web Monetization doesn't process or settle payments. Its role is to help coordinate payments. At each end of Web Monetization is an account that supports <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide">Open Payments</LinkOut>. The WM provider supplies the site's visitor with a sending account. In some cases, the visitor could even act as their own WM provider. The WM receiver supplies the recipient with a receiving account. Web Monetization helps obtain the account-level authorizations and instructions necessary to send a payment. Payment processing and settlement then occurs between the accounts, outside of Web Monetization.

## How to get started

:::caution[Payment pointers]
Payment pointers are a required component of Web Monetization; however, there are **no** payment pointer providers at this time. 

We'll update the site as providers become available. Once available, you can [add Web Monetization to an HTML page](/docs/guides/monetize-page).

## Prior specification version

A new version of the Web Monetization specification was published in June 2023. Users of the previous version should be aware of the following:

- The previous version only used Interledger's Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP). The new version uses <LinkOut href="https://docs.openpayments.guide/">Open Payments</LinkOut>.
- The `<meta>` element is deprecated in favor of the [`<link>`](./references/html-link-rel-monetization/) element.
- The `<link>` element does not support the shorthand form of a payment pointer (e.g., `$wallet.example/alice`). You must use the endpoint URL that the payment pointer resolves to (e.g., `https://wallet.example/alice`). If you need help converting a payment pointer from shorthand to its equivalent URL, enter your payment pointer into the input field on <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org">paymentpointers.org</LinkOut>. In most cases, you can simply replace the `$` with `https://`.
