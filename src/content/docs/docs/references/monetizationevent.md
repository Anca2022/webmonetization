<div class="draft"><h5>Page Updates</h5><ul><li>Add any appropriate links</li><li>Add spec and browser compat if appropriate</li><li>Is there a better way to do a table? (<strong>HJ replies</strong>: <em>tell me more about what better ways you had in mind?</em>)</li></ul></div>

The `MonetizationEvent` DOM events provide information about payments sent to WM receivers.

The `monetization` event fires on a `<link rel="monetization">` element when the WM agent successfully creates an outgoing payment. Thereâ€™s no guarantee that any payments will follow or, if they do, how often or how large the payments will be.

By listening for `monetization` events, you can use the returned details to verify the receipt of a payment. You can then choose to have the page programmatically respond to successful payments. For example, you could [hide ads](/docs/guides/hide-ads) or provide access to [exclusive content](/docs/guides/provide-exclusive-content).

<script>
  // Checking via DOMTokenList
  const link = document.querySelector('link[rel="monetization"]') || document.createElement('link')
  if (link.relList.supports('monetization')) {
    console.log('Web Monetization is supported.')
  }

  // Checking global scope for MonetizationEvent
  if (window.MonetizationEvent) {
    console.log('Web Monetization is supported.')
  }

  // Checking if it's a global event handler
  if (window.hasOwnProperty('onmonetization')) {
    console.log('Web Monetization is supported.')
