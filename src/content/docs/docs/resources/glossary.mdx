## A

### Account

The definition of account depends on its context. When we refer to an account, we typically mean a payment account. A payment account is an arrangement by which an entity sends, receives, holds, and keeps records of a user's credit or debit transactions. 

We assume that transactions are in one specific asset. If the user wants to transact in multiple assets, each asset will have a corresponding account. 

An Open Payments-enabled account is an account that supports the Open Payments APIs and has an assigned payment pointer. 

An account can also be an arrangement by which a user is given access to a service by entering a username and password. 

### Account servicing entity (AES)

An entity that provides and maintains a payment account for a payer and/or payee. An AES is a regulated entity within the country or countries it operates. Examples include digital wallets, banks, crypto wallets, and mobile money providers.

### Digital wallet

The term *digital wallet* can mean different things to different people, services, and technologies. We try to avoid over-using the term for this reason. However, in cases where we do reference digital wallets, it's within the context of Open Payments.

Open Payments defines a digital wallet as any Internet-connected system that acts as an agent of a person or business that is capable of sending and receiving payments from or to that person or business.

Since we use the Open Payments definition, we also assume that each digital wallet has implemented the Open Payments standard. Similarly, each digital wallet and/or payment account within the wallet has an associated payment pointer.

## O

### Open Payments (OP)

<LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide/">OpenPayments</LinkOut> is a specification for digital wallet providers that aims to define standards for access to digital wallets. When granted access, applications and other entities can integrate payments into their feature sets by connecting to their users' existing financial accounts, rather than requiring users to create new accounts. The ability to then execute payments between Open Payments-enabled wallets relies on the availability of a common payment rail between the wallets. 

Web Monetization relies on Open Payments though its use of payment pointers. 

## P

### Payment pointer

Every digital wallet (or account within a wallet, depending on implementation) that is accessible via <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.guide/">OpenPayments</LinkOut> is identified by a unique URL, called a <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org/">payment pointer</LinkOut>. This URL not only identifies the wallet, but also provides the entry point to the Open Payments API.

Conceptually, a payment pointer is like an email address for a wallet. It's a publicly shareable address used to grant and/or request authorization to interact with the underlying wallet. Example interactions include sending and receiving payments. 

A payment pointer is a required within the Web Monetization `<link>` element.

### Payment session

Each incoming payment is a payment session. 

During a single Web Monetization session, multiple payment sessions could occur:
* At the same time, when there's multiple monetization `<link>` elements on a page
* Sequentially, when an incoming payment completes/expires and a new incoming payment is created on the same payment pointer 

## U

### User agent

A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with Web content, or whose user interface is implemented using Web technologies. (<LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">W3C</LinkOut>)

A web browser is an example of a user agent.

## W
<hr />

### Web Monetization (WM)

A specification for allowing websites to automatically receive payments from users, facilitated by a user agent or Web Monetization agent, and the site visitor's preferred Web Monetization provider. 

### Web Monetization agent

Code within a web browser that discovers web monetized pages, exposes the Web Monetization API and communicates with the Open Payments API. 

When a vendor natively builds Web Monetization into their browser, the browser (user agent) acts as the Web Monetization agent. Until then, a separate Web Monetization agent, such as a browser extension, is required.

### Web Monetization payment

A payment that occurred due to a web monetized visitor accessing a web monetized page. 

We typically shorten the term to *payment* in the docs, but will prefix the term with *Web Monetization* or *WM* if needed for clarity. 

### Web Monetization provider

An entity or collection of entities that together enable Web Monetization payments to be sent on behalf of a user when the user visits a web monetized page. At minimum, a Web Monetization provider is an account servicing entity that supplies an Open Payments-enabled account from which to send payments. 

### Web Monetization receiver

An entity or collection of entities that together enable Web Monetization payments to be received and held on behalf of a user. At minimum, a Web Monetization receiver is an account servicing entity that supplies an Open Payments-enabled account capable of receiving payments.

### Web Monetization session

Each page load or refresh is a unique Web Monetization session (sometimes shortened to *monetization session*). The web browser generates a unique session ID which the website can use to correlate incoming payments to a client-side context. 

### Web monetized 

An adjective, most often used with the terms below, for describing something that uses or supports Web Monetization in some way.

#### Web monetized page, web monetized site

The terms *page* and *site* are used interchangeably within the docs; however, there is a technical difference to be aware of.

Web Monetization is configured at the page level. A web monetized page is a page that contains a well-formed monetization `<link>` element. For a site to truly be web monetized, each page of the site must have a `<link>` element. 

#### Web monetized user

A website visitor who has a relationship with a Web Monetization provider and on whose behalf the Web Monetization provider sends payments.
