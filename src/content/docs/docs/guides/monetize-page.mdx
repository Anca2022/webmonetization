title: Add Web Monetization to a page
---

This page provides basic instructions for adding Web Monetization to a web page. If you're new to web monetizing content, this page is a great place to start.

## Prerequisites

- Web monetized pages must be secure and served over HTTPS.
- You must have the payment pointer assigned to you by your WM receiver.

## Monetize a page

To add Web Monetization to a page, add the monetization `<link>` element to the page's `<head>`.

The elementâ€™s `rel` value is always `monetization`. The `href` value is a payment pointer in URL format.

For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Site</title>
    <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example/alice" />
  </head>
</html>
```

### Multiple monetization links

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, it's up to each WM provider to decide how they want to handle this scenario. We recommend WM providers split the payments evenly between the links.

## Next steps

Now that you've web monetized your page, you can choose to [hide ads](/docs/guides/hide-ads), [provide exclusive content](/docs/guides/provide-exclusive-content), or respond to [monetization events](/docs/references/monetizationevent) in some other way when a web monetized visitor accesses your page.
