A draft specification is being developed that is suitable for the W3C standards track.

The specification reflects the desired end-state of the standard and APIs and is not a good reference for current implementations (which are better described by the [API documentation](./api.html)).

The specification is available for review at 
[Web Monetization Specification](../specification.html).
