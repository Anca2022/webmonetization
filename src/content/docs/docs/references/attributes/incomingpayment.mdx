  ##### Page Updates

- Add any appropriate links
- Add browser compat if appropriate
- This page doesn't have a corresponding "incomingPayment.json". The published docs call receipts.json. Need to verify whether the info is the same, then make a specific file for incomingPayment.
- Verify example

The `MonetizationEvent` `incomingPayment` attribute returns a URL that represents an incoming payment at the monetization receiver.

## Value

A string that represents a URL that can be used to verify payment at the monetization receiver via the <LinkOut href="https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/get-incoming-payment">Open Payments API standard</LinkOut>. The returned value is the value it was initialized with.

## Example

```jsx
/** @type {MonetizationEvent} event */
async function verifyPayment(event) {
  // Legacy receivers don't support returning incoming payment URLs
  if (!event.incomingPayment) {
    throw new Error('No incoming payment URL')
  }

  const response = await fetch(event.incomingPayment, {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'same-origin',
    mode: 'same-origin',
    cache: 'no-cache',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  })

  if (response.ok) {
    // The incoming payment was fetched successfully
    const { receivedAmount } = JSON.parse(response.json())
    const { amount, assetCode, assetScale } = receivedAmount
    console.log(`Received ${assetCode}${amount / Math.pow(10, assetScale)}.`)
  }
}
```
